>A Customizable JS Wiki built on GitHub!

Welcome to FinnikyWiki, a contained Wiki that can be run locally or hosted via GitHub pages, and a sort of "mash-up" of <a href="https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5">@Jermolene's TiddlyWiki5</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sbrl/Pepperminty-Wiki/">@sbrl's PeppermintyWiki</a>. The project is open source under MIT License, which means anyone can Contribute, Fork, or Copy (though I would appreciate attribution)!

Built by <a href="https://github.com/flancast90">@flancast90</a>, a bit of Stack Overflow :), and the rest by contributors (like you!), FinnikyWiki is built to be a "revolutionary software," implementing the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/rest">GitHub API</a> to push regular changes, a comment system powered by <a href="https://github.com/utterance">Utteranc.es</a>, a JS login-feature also by <a href="https://github.com/flancast90">@flancast90</a>, and more, all without the need for a server, PHP, or any other "fun stuff."

**Latest Version:** [![stable version badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Stable-v.2-brightgreen)](https://github.com/flancast90/flancast90.github.io/releases/latest)

## To-Do:
This is an (ever-growing) list of all my <del>burdens and failures</del> things that I (hope) to add to FinnikyWiki2 in the future:
  - Better Revision-History (for example, be able to restore, compare, etc) 
  - SVG library for quick "click-and-go" messages or infographics
  - Page and User list (option for listing all *registered* users, and for displaying all pages in the wiki, linking back to the correct page)
  - Better security. Finniky is in its early stages, and already there are several serious issues. I plan to fix these with AES encryption, as well as improve      upon hosting files (trust me, it's hard using only client-side JS & HTML as well as no *.htaccess* files).
  - Add sponsor and star buttons to Wiki homepage (It'll help with college, hopefully!)
  - Have an idea? share it with me! <a href="mailto:flancast90@gmail.com">flancast90@gmail.com</a> or [open an issue](https://github.com/flancast90/flancast90.github.io/issues/new)


## Contributor How-To:
Contributions are very welcome! All you need to do is create a [Pull Request](https://github.com/flancast90/flancast90.github.io/compare) or make a [New Issue](https://github.com/flancast90/flancast90.github.io/issues/new). I'll do my best to add these after <del>painstaking review and hardship</del> (I swear, they're welcome). Please also make sure to include the code as released under the MIT License (so I can use it!).
